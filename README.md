# Soliton Map Learning

Final project for the "Models of Sequential Data" course in Skoltech, 2023.

## Getting Started

### Clone Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/dernall/soliton-map-learning.git
```

### Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download the dataset

Dataset consists of 5 different classes of solitons:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| cons one | Conservative soliton in one pulse regime (anomaly dispersion)|
| cons many | Conservative soliton in many pulse regime (anomaly dispersion)|
| dis stable | Dissipative soliton in one pulse regime (normal dispersion)|
| man pos | Maganed soliton in one pulse regime with positive dispersion coefficient (anomaly dispersion)|
| man neg | Managed soliton in one pusel regime with negative dispersion coefficient (normal dispersion)|
